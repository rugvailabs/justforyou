 * Where the backend lives, from the app's point of view.

 * On a simulator "localhost" is the simulator itself, and on a physical phone
 * it is the phone - so a hardcoded localhost works in exactly one of the three
 * places this app runs. Expo already knows the developer machine's LAN address
 * (it is how the bundle reached the device), so we borrow that host and swap
 * the port.
 *
 * Set EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL to override - a staging server, or a tunnel.
