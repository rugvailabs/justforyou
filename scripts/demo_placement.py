"""Give a few seeded listings subscriptions, so search placement is visible locally.

The seeded catalogue has no subscriptions, so every listing sits in the "no
plan" tier and search looks unchanged. This puts some Vancouver plumbers and
electricians on Annual, Monthly and Basic plans. Local demo data only: the
rows are marked `demo_placement_*` and --undo removes exactly those.

    docker exec justforyou_backend python -m scripts.demo_placement
    docker exec justforyou_backend python -m scripts.demo_placement --undo
