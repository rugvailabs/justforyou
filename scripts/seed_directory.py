"""Directory seed data: categories and Vancouver-area business listings.

Imported by scripts.seed so `python -m scripts.seed` populates everything.

All business names, addresses, phone numbers and websites below are invented.
They are shaped like real Vancouver listings so the search, distance and rating
filters have something plausible to work on - they are not real businesses.

Coordinates are real neighbourhood centroids, which is what makes the "near me"
path testable: the reference point used in development is downtown Vancouver at
(49.28, -123.12).

# Opening hours, by category.
#
# Stored the way app/models/business.py holds them - {"mon": [["09:00","17:00"]]}
# - with an absent or empty day meaning closed. Assigned per category rather
# than per listing because the trade is what actually determines them: a
# plumber opens before an office does, and a salon is shut on Monday.
#
# Two shapes here exist to exercise the reader rather than to decorate the
# seed. Restaurants carry a split service - lunch, a gap, then dinner - which a
# renderer that flattens ranges would wrongly show as open all afternoon. Their
# Friday and Saturday close at 00:30, which is before the open time and so
# crosses midnight; getOpenState() handles that, and nothing else in the seed
# would prove it.
