"""One-off: move the existing seeded catalogue from Toronto to Vancouver.

Updates the 34 seeded rows IN PLACE rather than deleting and reseeding. That
matters because reviews, enquiries and chat threads reference businesses.id: a
delete would CASCADE and take the demo history with it, while an update leaves
every child row attached to the same listing, now in a different city.

Matched on either the old Toronto slug or the new Vancouver one, so the script
is idempotent and also repairs a partially-applied run.
