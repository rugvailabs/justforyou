"""Business verification (KYC).

One row per listing, holding what the owner submitted to prove the business is
real - contact details, a trade licence, a GST/HST number - and a moderator's
decision on it.

Deliberately a separate table from `businesses` rather than more columns on it:

  - The documents are the sensitive part. Keeping them in their own table means
    the public listing query never selects a licence number by accident, and a
    future retention policy can drop this table without touching the directory.
  - Moderating a listing's *content* and verifying its *identity* are different
    decisions made at different times. A listing can be approved and unverified
    (a moderator liked the copy, nobody has checked the licence yet), or
    verified and suspended. Two statuses, two trails.

Both must be positive before the listing appears in public search - see
search_businesses() in app/api/v1/businesses.py.
