    Under the prefork pool each child runs tasks in its own process, so the
    model has to exist in the child - loading it in the parent before the fork
    is not reliably inherited by CTranslate2. Doing it here means the first
    real submission does not pay the several-second load, and the model is
    never reloaded per task.

    Worker concurrency is capped in docker-compose for exactly this reason:
    every child holds its own copy of the weights.
