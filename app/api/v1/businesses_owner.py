"""Owner-facing listing management.

Split from businesses.py so the public search surface and the authenticated
owner surface stay visibly separate - it should be obvious at a glance which
routes are reachable without a token.

ROUTE ORDER MATTERS. FastAPI matches in declaration order, so the literal
paths here ("/owner/mine", "/by-slug/{slug}") must be registered before the
parameterised "/{business_id}" or "owner" gets parsed as a business id and
422s instead of routing.
