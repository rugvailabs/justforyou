"""Lead capture and the owner's leads inbox.

Two endpoints with deliberately opposite access rules on the same resource:

  POST /businesses/{id}/enquiries  - anyone, signed in or not, may leave a lead
  GET  /businesses/{id}/enquiries  - only the listing's owner may read them

Getting that asymmetry wrong in either direction is the whole risk here: a
locked-down POST loses leads from anonymous visitors, and a loose GET exposes
one business's customer list to another.
