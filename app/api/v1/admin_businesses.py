"""Admin moderation of directory listings.

Every route here is admin-only, and every decision writes an audit row naming
the moderator - matching the submission review console in review.py. A listing
going live, or being pulled down, is exactly the kind of action that needs to
be attributable later.

Approve/reject/suspend are separate verbs rather than one PATCH of `status`
because they are not symmetric: a rejection and a suspension both require a
reason the owner will read, an approval does not.
