"""Plans, checkout and subscription state.

Paying affects ORDER in search, never VISIBILITY: a business with no plan is
still found, below the Featured (Annual), Promoted (Monthly) and Basic tiers,
and every paid position is labelled on the result card. Visibility is still
decided by moderation and verification alone. See app/services/placement.py.

The endpoints are real and work today. With no STRIPE_SECRET_KEY configured
they run in stub mode: subscription rows are created and move through their
states, the checkout URL is a placeholder, and no money moves. See
