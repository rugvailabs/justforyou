"""Support messages: questions, feedback and bug reports.

These come to us rather than to a business, which is what separates them from
an enquiry. Anyone may send one, signed in or not - the person best placed to
report that sign-up is broken is precisely someone who could not complete one.

The row is written first and the notification email sent afterwards, on a
best-effort basis: if SMTP is down, the message is still recorded and the
endpoint still reports success, because losing somebody's bug report to a mail
outage is the one failure mode worth designing against here.
