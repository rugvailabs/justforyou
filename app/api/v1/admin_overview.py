"""Admin overview stats and review moderation.

Listing moderation lives in admin_businesses.py; this is the rest of the admin
surface. Both are behind require_admin.

Deleting a review is the one destructive action an admin has here, so it
writes an audit row carrying enough of the deleted content to answer "what was
removed, and by whom" after the fact - the row itself is gone.
