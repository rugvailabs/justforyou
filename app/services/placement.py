"""Paid placement in search: which subscription tier a listing is in.

Search orders every result set by tier before anything else:

    1  annual    Annual subscribers              badge ⭐ Featured
    2  monthly   Monthly subscribers, rotating   badge 📈 Promoted
    3  basic     the free Basic plan
    4  none      no active subscription

Placement changes ORDER, never VISIBILITY. Whether a listing appears at all is
still decided by moderation and verification alone (app/core/visibility.py);
a business that pays nothing is still found, just further down. Paid tiers are
labelled on every result card, because in Canada a ranking bought with money
has to be disclosed as such.

A subscription counts while it is `active` and its paid period has not ended.
Basic has no period end, so it counts for as long as it is active. A listing
with more than one live subscription gets its best tier.

MONTHLY ROTATION. Monthly subscribers are ranked against each other in a fixed
pseudo-random order (a hash of the listing id, so no one is permanently first
by being oldest), and every 30 minutes that order rotates by three places: the
three at the front of the Monthly group change each window, and over enough
windows every Monthly subscriber has its turn. It is computed from the clock
alone - the same query in the same window gives the same page to everyone, and
there is no state to store or expire.
