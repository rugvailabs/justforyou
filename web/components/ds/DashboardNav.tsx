/**
 * Navigation across one listing's owner surfaces.
 *
 * The same problem AdminNav fixed, one level down: every dashboard subpage had
 * a back-link to /dashboard and no way to reach a sibling, so an owner
 * answering a review and then checking their leads went up and down through
 * the listings index twice. With more than one listing that is worse, because
 * the index does not remember which listing they were working on.
 *
 * The count sits on Reviews for the reason AdminNav puts counts on queues: the
 * owner's next question after editing a listing is whether anything is waiting
 * on them. It is omitted rather than zeroed when it could not be loaded - no
 * badge is better than a wrong one.
