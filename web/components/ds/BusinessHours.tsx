/**
 * The week's opening hours, with today marked.
 *
 * Reads the same shape getOpenState() does - {"mon": [["09:00","17:00"]]} -
 * and renders the seven days in the order the locale starts its week, which is
 * Sunday under en-CA and Monday under fr-CA. Hardcoding Monday-first would be
 * wrong for half this directory's audience.
 *
 * A day the business does not open is shown as "Closed" rather than omitted:
 * a table with Tuesday missing reads as an oversight, one that says Tuesday is
 * closed reads as a fact. Multiple ranges in a day - the lunch-break split
 * that is normal for a restaurant - are stacked rather than flattened into a
 * single span that would claim the business is open through the gap.
 *
 * This renders only when the listing genuinely has hours. The caller decides;
 * see the profile page, which falls back to OpenStatus's "Hours not listed".
