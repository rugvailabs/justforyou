/**
 * Reviews management for one listing.
 *
 * Server Component. Ownership follows the same pattern as the edit and leads
 * pages: the backend 403s a listing owned by someone else, and that becomes a
 * redirect to /dashboard rather than a crash.
 *
 * Owners can reply but not delete - removing a review is an admin action in
 * the backend, and a business deleting its own bad reviews would make the
 * whole rating meaningless.
 *
 * The summary here is the real one, from the reviews endpoint, not the
 * denormalised rating on the business row. On this page that distinction
 * matters: an owner looking at their own reviews is counting the ones they
 * have to answer, and the row's number does not correspond to them.
