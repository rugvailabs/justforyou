/**
 * Verification (KYC) for one listing.
 *
 * The panel above the form is the point of this page as much as the form is:
 * an owner whose listing is approved but invisible needs to see *which* of the
 * two gates is holding it, and a rejected owner needs the reviewer's words.
 *
 * Server Component - it reads the listing and its verification with the
 * owner's cookie, and the form below is the only client part.
